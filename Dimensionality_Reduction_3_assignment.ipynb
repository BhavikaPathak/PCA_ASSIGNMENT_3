    "Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are important concepts in linear algebra, particularly in the context of square matrices. Given a square matrix A, an eigenvector is a non-zero vector v such that when A is multiplied by v, the result is a scaled version of v. The scaling factor is represented by a scalar λ, known as the eigenvalue. In other words, if Av = λv, then v is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue λ.\n",

    "The Eigen-Decomposition approach involves decomposing a square matrix A into a product of three matrices: A = PDP^(-1), where P is a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of A, and D is a diagonal matrix containing the corresponding eigenvalues on the diagonal. This approach is used to diagonalize the matrix, making it easier to analyze and perform certain operations.\n",

    "Eigen decomposition is a method used in linear algebra to factorize a square matrix into a product of three matrices: A = PDP^(-1), where P is a matrix containing the eigenvectors of A, and D is a diagonal matrix containing the corresponding eigenvalues. The significance of eigen decomposition lies in its ability to transform a possibly complex matrix into a diagonal form, where the diagonal elements (eigenvalues) represent the scaling factors, and the transformation matrix (eigenvectors) captures the directions of the scaled vectors.\n",

The diagonalization implies that P^(-1) exists, which is only possible when the eigenvectors are linearly independent. If the eigenvectors are not linearly independent, P^(-1) would not exist, and A cannot be diagonalized."

    "The spectral theorem is significant in the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach because it guarantees that a square matrix is diagonalizable if it satisfies certain conditions. The spectral theorem states that if a matrix is symmetric, it will have a full set of orthogonal eigenvectors, making it diagonalizable.\n",

Since A is symmetric, the spectral theorem assures us that the eigenvectors are orthogonal (v1 and v2 are orthogonal), and thus A is diagonalizable."
